Kodein for Kotlin Native
========================

**THIS PROJECT IS NOT FUNCTIONAL YET!!!**

At the moment, Kotlin Native is missing some features needed by Kodein.

Kodein will work on Native platforms as soon as Kotlin Native supports:

* ~~Library format~~ *(supported since Native 0.3)*
* A basic support for `T::class` (with at least `simpleName`)
* Support for the `@Volatile` annotations
* Support for the `@DslMarker` annotations
