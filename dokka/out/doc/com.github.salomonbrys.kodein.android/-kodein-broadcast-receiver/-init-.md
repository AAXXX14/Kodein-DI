`KodeinBroadcastReceiver()`

A base class that manages a [BroadcastReceiverInjector](../-broadcast-receiver-injector/index.md) for easy bootstrapping of Kodein.
Injections will be available as soon as [onBroadcastReceived](on-broadcast-received.md) is called and will be destroyed immediately after it returns.
